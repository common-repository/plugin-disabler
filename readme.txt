WordPress offers a lot of free and paid plugins that can be downloaded easily. It makes sense to utilize this feature but if too many are installed it will affect the loading speed of the website greatly. It does not make sense to use load all the resources of the plugin on the pages where it's not being used at all. 


Maximize all plugins and optimize it at the same time.
